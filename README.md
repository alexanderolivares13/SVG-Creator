# SVG-Creator

  ## Description
  
  This project was created to help users generate an SVG file for 3 basic shapes. The output file is a 300x200 generated SVG file of a Triangle, Square, or Circle. The file is generated based on the users input. This project aided in furthering my understanding of object oriented programming and gave me a fundamental better understanding of using classes to help my code do more while writitng less. The ability to create and extend classes so that functions can be shared across different constructers proved to be extremely useful. Overall this project challeneged my understanding of this module and helped further cement what I've learned up to this point.
